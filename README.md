# bitsquatting

Like typosquatting, bitsquatting is the practice of registering domain names that are 1-bit off from a popular domain name.
If the the original domain name receives enough traffic, the bitsquatted domain could siphon traffic originally destined fro the original domain name.
For information about this, see https://remyhax.xyz/posts/bitsquatting-windows/ and http://dinaburg.org/bitsquatting.html.

This project is a web app that makes it super easy to find bitsquatted domains.
